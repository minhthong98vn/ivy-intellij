# ivy-intellij
Unofficial IntelliJ Plugin for Axon.ivy Framework

## Why does this thing exist?
We are developers who are working for years in Ivy based projects. It was painful to work with Ivy Designer at the time 
(poor performance, buggy). We decided to improve our development experience by switching to IntelliJ. That's why Ivy 
plugin was created.

## What problems does this thing solve?
* Poor Java development experience: we switched to the best Java IDE, all Java programming features are working 
correctly.
* Poor IDE performance: the starting time of IDE is shorter than before, GUI is running smoothly.
* Environment difference: we experienced some bug because of the difference between Ivy Designer and Ivy Engine. Now, 
with Ivy plugin, we run our code in Ivy Engine, no more different.

## Problems this thing DOES NOT solve
* Ivy plugin does not support all Ivy Designer features, example: create project, global variable, cms, demo user/role..
* Official support from Axon.ivy

## Let's play with the plugin. Getting started by installation
* Official release: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12688-ivy
* Early access: https://github.com/saigonwithlove/ivy-intellij/releases

Don't worry if you can not see anything after installation. Ivy plugin only show up if you correctly import an Ivy
module to your project.
